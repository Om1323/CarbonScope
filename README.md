# CarbonScope
A machine learning project for profiling and clustering carbon emissions data
# CarbonScope+: Machine Learning Pipeline for Carbon Profiling and Product Clustering

## 🌍 Overview

**CarbonScope+** is a demonstration project aligned with the goals of the Neutreeno Research Assistant role. It simulates key tasks in emissions analysis and sustainability-focused data science using advanced machine learning techniques.

This includes:
- Company profiling and clustering based on emissions and operational features
- Product clustering using dimensionality reduction
- Visualization of industrial production processes
- Advanced imputation for missing environmental data
- Summarization of scientific literature using NLP tools

## 🧠 Project Objectives

1. Develop a taxonomy of companies using unsupervised ML
2. Cluster products based on energy, water, and emission metrics
3. Create visual models of production processes
4. Handle missing carbon data with dynamic calibration
5. Extract and summarize knowledge from academic research

## 🔍 Project Components

### 🔹 1. Company Taxonomy and Profiling
- Used PCA and HDBSCAN to cluster 20 synthetic companies
- Features: revenue, emissions, sustainability score, etc.

### 🔹 2. Product Clustering
- UMAP + HDBSCAN to group 20 products by energy and material usage
- Shows how product types can be classified without labels

### 🔹 3. Production Process Mapping
- Graph-based modeling using NetworkX to represent production flows
- Useful for understanding dependencies and inefficiencies

### 🔹 4. Dynamic Data Calibration
- Used IterativeImputer to simulate smart default values
- Addresses real-world issues with missing environmental data

### 🔹 5. Scientific Literature Aggregation
- Summarized multiple ML-based climate papers using extractive techniques
